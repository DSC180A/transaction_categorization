## Rethinking Credit Scores
## Ensuring Fair Lending through NLP for Transaction Categorization

The invention of credit has reshaped modern personal finance. For most, a credit card provides an opportunity to buy something you can't afford in full, such as a car or a home. However, for others, credit is seen as a barrier. Because of the nature of how credit scores are calculated, certain groups, often referred to as the "credit invisible" are neglected. These individuals may be credit invisible for any number of reasonsâ€“ they may be a young adult, or may have recently immigrated to a new country. Regardless, this group of "credit invisible" individuals often struggle to be approved for loans because they have no credit history.

In our project, we aim to cater to this "credit invisible" group by creating a tool that is able to classify transaction memos from an individual's checking history. We are working with industry partner Petal, a financial services company who uses an alternative metric, called the "CashScore", as opposed to a conventional credit score.
